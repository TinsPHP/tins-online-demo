# TinsPHP: Online Demo Application

A simple servlet based online demo application which shows how PHP is translated to TSPHP (and what types are inferred exactly).
Visit the [online demo](http://tsphp.ch/demo/tins) to try it out yourself.

The demo application is very similar to the [client-based demo application](http://tsphp.ch/jenkins/job/TinsPHP_dev/lastSuccessfulBuild/) which can be found on the build server.

Please visit the [project's website](http://tsphp.ch/tins) for more information on the project.
Use the project's [issue tracking system](http://tsphp.ch/tins/jira) (JIRA) to report bugs or submit feature requests.
